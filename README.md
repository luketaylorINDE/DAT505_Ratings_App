# DAT505_Ratings_App
The idea of this project was to create a "ratings" app, focusing on a product or service of my choice. This app gives the user the ability to rate cars.

app requirements:
- Unique ID for the item
- Name of the item
- Photo of the item
- Geolocation of where the item can be found
- Various item-specific categories (depends on the type of item you choose !)
- Overall rating (from 1 to 5 stars)

This app was build using the following technologies:
- ionic
- phonegap
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
